## Explanation of architecture

### TypeScript

- I decided to use typeScript to help me with the data that came from JSON and to avoid trash code, like unused variable, components and etc.

### Folders

#### components

- All components

#### config

- The Firebase config

#### services

- A class with all methods used in this project to connect with the Firebase

#### styles

- A global css file

- The movie.json types and the types to save on Firebase

## What to improve

- Pagination
- Envs vars to hide some firebase keys
- Unit test for some important components
- Cosmetics updates
